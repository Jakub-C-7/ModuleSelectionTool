# ModuleSelectionTool---Project

  Technical Purpose of writing the application
----
This is a Java application which I wrote in early 2020 as a part of my academic journey.

The project takes object oriented software development practices and focuses on applying them rigorously. 

Some of the industry practices used in my project include but are not limited to:
- model-view-controller architecture, event handling, GUI (design and implementation), files, IO, exceptions, collections, functional interfaces, data validation, and nested classes.

I put these practices into play in a well-written and documented set of code.

  Application Functions
  ----
This application at it's core will allow a user to sign-up, log-in and after selecting a course of study, select their desired final-year modules.
